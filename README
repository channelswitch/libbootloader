This project implements a bootloader in the form of a shared library for Linux.
The library automatically scans hard drives and removable media for bootable
operating systems. The user can then request that they be booted into.

At that point, the library will shut down the operating system, but instead of
resetting the power on the computer, the other operating system is booted into.
The Kexec system call is used to accomplish this.

BIOS interrupts are used by operating systems early on to read from hard drives
and do other things. These interrupts often stop working after the first time
an operating system switches to 32-bit mode -- also known as protected mode
(x86 computers start in 16-bit mode -- also known as real mode -- for backwards
compatibility). For this reason, this library must boot operating systems via
their 32-bit entry point.

The downside of this is that every operating system must have its own support
in the library. In its current state the library only supports booting Linux.
There is code written to boot Windows, but I was unable to get it working.
